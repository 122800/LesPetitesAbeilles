# Hello :)

Ready to start doing some OP OOP stuff?

All of your work will be contained within the package *BonnetZone*.
Don't worry about the package *main*, it's just there to make sure
you have a nice-looking interface when you test your code ;)

Go ahead and open up **BonnetApplication.java**.
This is your application. It will contain a list of all your bees,
as well as the beehive.

Keep in mind that this is not a static class! When you launch your
application, an instance of *BonnetApplication* will be created.
This means you need to fill out the constructor. Then, void run()
will be called. This is what launches your code.

First order of business:

##	Let's create a bee!

Create the class <Abeille> in package *BonnetZone* and make it
implement the interface *IDisplayable*.

Remember to let your IDE do the work! Just enter the first few
letters, hit ctrl+space and it'll suggest the correct import.

Can you get the IDE to implement all the necessary methods
automatically?

### Ok

Ok I'm tired of writing so I'll just say the rest in person :P
