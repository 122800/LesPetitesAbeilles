# Hello :)

Ready to start doing some OP OOP stuff?

First order of business:

##	Let's create a bee!

All of your work will be contained within the package 'BonnetZone'.
Don't worry about the package 'main', it's just there to make sure
you have a nice-looking interface when you test your code ;)

Go ahead and open up 'BonnetApplication.java'.
This is your application. It will contain a list of all your bees,
as well as the beehive.
Keep in mind that this is not a static class! When you launch your
application, an instance of 'BonnetApplication' will be created.
This means you need to fill out the constructor. Then, void run()
will be called. This is what launches your code.

Create the class <Abeille> in package 'BonnetZone'.
